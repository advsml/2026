## Workshop Overview

This two-day scientific workshop aims to bring together leading researchers in the field of spatial machine learning. 
Unlike many conferences that focus on showcasing achievements, our goal is to address unsolved issues and open questions, fostering innovation and collaboration.

<!-- ## Key Topics -->

<!-- 1. **Validation and Preservation of Spatial Patterns**: Ensuring models provide accurate local predictions while preserving important spatial patterns. -->
<!-- 2. **Comparable Approaches Across Algorithm Types**: Investigating how different algorithms (e.g., traditional vs. deep learning) can be compared and integrated for improved spatial predictions. -->
<!-- 3. **Analysis and Communication of Prediction Uncertainties**: Discussing methods for analyzing and communicating uncertainties in spatial predictions for informed decision-making. -->
<!-- 4. **Standardized Documentation Protocols**: Developing standardized documentation for spatial machine learning models to enhance reproducibility and knowledge transfer. -->
<!-- 5. **Comparability between Wrapper Packages**: Exploring differences and similarities between popular software packages like caret/CAST, tidymodels, mlr3, and sits to promote interoperability. -->
<!-- 6. **Cutting-Edge Developments**: A session dedicated to discussing the latest developments and emerging trends in spatial machine learning. -->

## Location and Date

The workshop will take place 9-10 April 2026 at the University of Tartu, Estonia.

<!-- The address is: -->
